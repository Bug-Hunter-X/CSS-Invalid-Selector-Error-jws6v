This repository demonstrates a common yet often overlooked CSS error: the use of invalid or unsupported selectors.  The `bug.css` file contains the problematic code.  The solution (`bugSolution.css`) provides a corrected version using a more widely supported and valid approach. The issue results in inconsistent styling across different browsers because the problematic selector is not interpreted correctly by certain browsers. This example highlights the importance of using well-supported CSS selectors and validating your CSS for compatibility.
