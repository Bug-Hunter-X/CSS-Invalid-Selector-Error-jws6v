The CSS code has an invalid or unsupported selector that isn't compatible with all browsers. For example, using a very old or experimental selector or an attribute selector with invalid syntax. This can lead to styles not being applied or unexpected behavior.  Example:  `div[attribute='value'] > * { color: red; }` - if the `attribute` is not valid or there are syntax issues with the selector, it will fail.
